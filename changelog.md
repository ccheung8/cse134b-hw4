I updated the work and about page of my portfolio. 

For the work page, I added javascript as well as a CSS keyframe animation to the hero section of my website. I also changed my hero text from h1 to h2 and changed the "my work" title from h2 to h1. This is so I followed the standards of one h1 per page and I believe "my work" better describes the title of the page.

For the about page, I expanded it and added a "values" section where I added a neon text shadow effect to the titles as well as a keyframe animation for letters to flicker.

I changed the font of my paragraphs because I didn't like the look of Roboto that much. I researched font pairings and came accross and font I liked called Karla.

I also added Google analytics to my site. This is so I can optimize user experience and analyze pages recruiters or general visiters spend the most time in.
